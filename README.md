             👋 Hi there, I'm Boniface Mwau!

👀 I'm interested in exploring the intersection of technology, creativity and future trends in Artificial Intelligence. 

🌱 I'm currently learning web development(JAVASCRIPT, HTML, CSS, REACT, DJANGO, LARAVEL) and machine learning(PYTHON), in my third year, Bsc. Computer Science, Maseno university. 

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on open-source projects that make a positive impact on society.

📫 You can reach me via email at foxhtro@gmail.com. 

⚡ Fun fact: I'm an avid hiker and love exploring the great outdoors, especially camping 🏕, whenever I get the chance!
